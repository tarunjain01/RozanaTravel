RozanaTravel
============

This repository contains the source code for the WebApp which solves two of the basis dail travel problems : 
1) City Bus timings as it does bus tracking based on the data provided by users 
2) Lift facilitator and it again relies on user data.

It uses google geocoding api to get the lat lang and based on the radius specified search for the buses in the
vicinity. Same principle is applied during the lift facilitation but contact is necessary due to security considerations.
It can be made private in the future for the common group of users.
